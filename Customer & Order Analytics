In this project, I used SQL to query a sales database to answer the following questions:

1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT location, COUNT(orderID) 
FROM JanSales
WHERE location like '%New York City%'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>=3;

2. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT distinct product, sum(quantity) AS 'Quantity Sold'
FROM FebSales
WHERE product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY product

3. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT SUM(price*quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

4. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity*price) as Revenue 
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product 
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) DESC
LIMIT 1
